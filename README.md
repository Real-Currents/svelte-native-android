After installing NativeScript globally with `npm -g install nativescript` and then installing dependencies locally with `npm install`, use the `tns preview`, `tns build` or `tns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application. To build the android application locally, you must install and configure the Android SDK and ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```bash
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```
